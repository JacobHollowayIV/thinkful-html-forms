# thinkful-html-forms
Thinkful Assessment for a simple HTML form.
This form has inputs for name, email, and a message, request type plus a submit button.
The Name, Email, and request type were all group together to style better on larger screens, tested using Google Chrome's dev tools.
I added a 95% to the boxes for mobile, and 98% for larger screens, as that seemed to be the sweet spot.
